HIPC (Human Immunology Project Consortium, https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/human-immunology-project-consortium) Transcriptional Profiling Data Standard

The HIPC Data Standards Working group proposes the following data standard for transcriptional profiling (microarray and RNA-seq) data standard:

	Raw (e.g., .cel files) should be submitted to GEO
		Processed data (expression values used in publication) should be submitted to GEO
	For RNA-seq:
		Raw data (FASTQ) should be submitted to SRA
		Processed data (e.g., TPM values) should be submitted to GEO

ImmPort will link to these data using the Experiment Sample templates, which will include:

	Repository Name: GEO. 
	Repository Accession: the GEO sample accession number (GSMxxx). 
	For RNA-seq data, the GSM record in GEO should include a reference to the SRA accession for the raw data. Note that for next-generation sequencing, GEO can broker the complete set of raw data files (e.g., FASTQ) to the SRA database on your behalf (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/info/faq.html#rawdata).

RECOMMENDATION: After ImmPort data submission, the GEO metadata in the SOFT file should be updated to include a link back to the data in ImmPort . This will make users of GEO aware that related data is available through ImmPort. This should be done by including the tag: !Sample_ImmPort_expsamp_acc = ImmPort ExperimentSample ID
